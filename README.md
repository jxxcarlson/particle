Particle
========

`Particle` is a package for simple physics simulations.
The idea is to set up a particle with a certain
mass, initial position, initial velocity, and shape
(rectangle or ellipse for now).  Then to define a field,
e.g. the gravitational field.  The package gives tools
for constructing  

```
     orbit = [a, f a, f^2 a, ... , f^n a]
```

where   `a`   is the particle in its initial state and
the function   `f`   is the "next-state" function which
evolves the particle according to some discrete version
of Newton's laws of motion.  The resulting list
of particles can then be rendered as a list of SVG
elements by

```
    renderedOrbit = List.map draw orbit
```

I will document this better later , but for now, look
in the examples folder for demo code:

Demo 1:

```
   $ cd examples
   $ elm make StaticBouncingBall.elm
```

Demo 2:

```
   $ elm make BouncingBall.elm
```

In both cases a ball is subject to two forces.  The first
is the constant downward force of gravity.  The second
is a short-range upward force localized in the "floor".
This force decays exponentially with height.

NOTE: I need to do some optimization in Demo 2.  The
simulation slows down as it progresses.  Pull requests
appreciated!
