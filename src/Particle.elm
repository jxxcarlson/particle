module Particle exposing (Particle, Field, constantField, draw, make, orbit, affineTransform, update)

{-| A `Particle` has mass, position, velocity, and shape.

  - Construct a particle using `make mass position velociy shape`.

  - Use `draw particle` to obtain an Svg representation of a particle.

  - Use `update t force particle` to return an updated version of the
    particle under the influence of the given force acting for time t.

  - Use `orbit n stepper initiaValue` to obtain the "orbit" of a particle
    consisting of n updates using the `stepper` function.

A `stepper` function is of type `Particle -> Particle`. As an example,
consider the function

      sf = Particle.update 0.75 force,

where `force = Vector 0 -5` is force vector and 0.75 is an interval of time. Then
`sf`, which is a partial application of `Particle.update`, is a stepper
function.
